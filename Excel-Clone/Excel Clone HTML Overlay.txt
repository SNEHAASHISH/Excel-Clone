CSS Height Allocatio by Div:
---------------------------

100 vh is full screen in CSS
Height percentage given inside () next to the specified container
In CSS * { } refers to all elements


# Issue with height of container: 
	There was margin and it was scrolling to remedy this
	overflow attribute is hidden and margin set to 0

# Red border not visible on downside as 2 px is taken by upper edge which puts the border external to window i.e. 100 vh + 2px + padding
	box-sizing set to border-box

# Text in Div by default is on top left side in black color font, flexbox resolves this
	flex-direction row/column put elements horizontally/vertically center justified
	i.e.
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	centrally aligns content in div 

# By default div elements are in bloc not inline hence flex-direction needs to be set to row...
	By default flex-direction is row
